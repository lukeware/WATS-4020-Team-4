# WATS2020: Professional Practice

This repository is where you will do your work for WATS2020: Professional Practice. Throughout this course we will break into groups and work through several assignments where you will simulate a web production environment. This will involve coming up with requirements, user stories, estimating sizes, prioritizing work, and then actually completing some work and collaborating together using branches and pull requests.

The point of these assignments, and this repository, **is not** to train serious technical skills or the "buttonology" of Github. Although we will be using a workflow that is designed for use with Github and similar tools, the general principles of effective communication and collaboration are the most important to learn. The tools we use will evolve and change over time, but the basic goal of working together in an effective and efficient way remains.

## What is This?

This is the imaginary project you will be working on for the next seven weeks.

This repository sets up the context for your work in this course. It provides a Wiki populated with some beginnings of project documentation, and it gives you a basic HTML template to build on as you create the first version of the project defined in the Wiki of this repository. This course does require some simple HTML creation, and you will be working with Git and Github to enact a specific workflow. This repository is where all of that work will happen. Ultimately, your Group will deploy your work using Github pages.

The Wiki for this repository is set up as if you have just joined the team building a new website. The groundwork for how the project will be run has been established, so you have project resources such as a project abstract, defined workflow and templates for requirements and user stories. The system is ready for you to begin filling in the details.

You will also make extensive use of the Issues tool in Github once you get into running your sprint. This tool will allow you to create different issues and work on them as you work through your sprint.

Finally, you will use a workflow that makes use of the Github Pull Request feature to allow for controlled code reviews and change management. The Pull Request is a concept unique to Github, but based on common methods for collaborating via "patches".

This is our playground for the quarter. This is our dungeon to explore.

## How to Use This Repository

First, doublecheck that you are in the correct location. Look at the name of this repository and make sure it matches the name of your Group in Canvas. You have been placed in a group with some of your classmates, and these are the people you will be collaborating with.

If you're in the correct location, then you should be able to use this repository and the associated Github tools to complete your assignment. Each assignment will detail what requirements you must fulfill in order to successfully complete the assignment goals.

For many assignments you will be working with the Wiki and Issues features of this repository. These tools are always available from the link on the right side of each page inside this repository. If you require help using the Github Wiki or Issues tools, consult these links:

* [About Github Wikis](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/)
* [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)

There are many more articles and videos available to help you with Github. Begin your searches on the [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/) site.

At some point you will likely need to clone the repository to your development machine. You may use a browser-based IDE (like [Code Anywhere](http://codeanywhere.com)) or you may work locally. Remember to use the SSH Clone URL when cloning the repository so you can contribute back easily when the time comes.

For additional information, consult the individual assignment pages in Canvas.

**Please Note:** You may come up with whatever ideas you want regarding the development of this project. You should allow your imagination and intellect run wild. But please realize that you will not be actually building the things you suggest. All the time we have this quarter allows for is one or two tasks per person, which means your project will be far from complete at the end of this quarter. **That is OK!** And it is expected.
